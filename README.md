# About the Project

ðŸ‘‹ Hey, this is the source code for my website https://paralax.xyz. It's primarily for my Graphic Design GCSE, but also a showcase for my computer science projects.

It's constantly being redone (because I'm incredibly indecisive and strive for perfection), and you can see current changes on teh development branch, or at https://development.paralax.xyz, although beware that there may be some incomplete features.

# Feedback

If you have any features or bugs you'd like to report, please feel free to open an issue, or dm me on discord. I'm always willing to further expand my knowledge in this field, and to discuss various projects.

This also applies to any of the actual projects on my website. Whilst some of the projects have been marked, it will all be taken back into consideration, as there is no 2022 exam for graphics due to the pandemic.

# Usage

You may use it as a rough template and to add features to, but please don't try to pass it off as your own, and if you do use it for a personal project, please mention either my [Github](https://github.com/paralaxdev), [My Website](https://paralax.xyz) or my discord Paralax#7228.
